This game brings your favorite pubs weekly trivia to your house where the beer is a little cheeper and the seats are a little more comfortable.

The main challenge for this game was in using .setInterval() and .setTimeout() functions to alter elements and the DOM and also to make sure the users have the appropriate amount of time to interact with the content.

When you open the web page you are presented with a large green start button, once you press this button there is no going back, no way to pause.

upon clicking start the first question is presented, 
you have 15 seconds to desice what the answer is.
There are 3 outcomes to this;
either you run out of time, it states as such, and the incorrect counter increases by 1,
you get it incorrect, it states as such, and again increases the incorrect counter by 1,
or you get it correct, it states as such, and increases your correct counter by 1.

After 1 of those 3 things occurs. it gives you 7 seconds to process the outcome and the correct answer, then get ready for the next question.

lather, rinse, repeat 9 times and at the end of the game it give your the total correct and incorrect as well as the option to restart from the top.

There is only 1 set of questions at the moment but I still think it is a nifty game and runs very smoothly.

Hope you enjoy!!
